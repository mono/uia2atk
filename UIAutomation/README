UIAutomation is a project of the Mono Accessibility team. Its purpose is to
implement assemblies that define common types, interfaces, and identifiers
defined in Microsoft's UIA specification.  More information about the Mono
Accessibility team and UIA on Linux can be found on our wiki:

1. Package contents
===================

Implementation of Microsoft UI Automation (UIA) assemblies.  This package
provides the following assemblies:

	UIAutomationHelpers.dll Internal helpers public for other assemblies.
	UIAutomationTypes.dll: Types, constants, and identifiers.
	UIAutomationProvider.dll: Provider pattern interface definitions.
	UIAutomationClient.dll: Types used by UIA clients to get element info.
	( See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747327.aspx )

	UIAutomationBridge.dll: Defines interfaces unique to Mono's UIA
	                        implementation, that must be implemented by
	                        compatible a11y bridges or providers.

	WindowsBase.dll: Minimal version of this otherwise-unreleased assembly,
	                 containing only the types needed by the above DLLs.
	                 Development can be tracked in the olive module in SVN.
